## Current Status (UPDATE July 13th '18)

This is an active fork of zenbot4. It is a complete rewrite and rethinking of the entire platform. The overall goals of zenbot5 are:

- reducing code repitition
- separation of concerns
- rewrite everything in typescript
- getting rid of all the callbacks
- allow multiple strategies to run simultaneously
- a complete overhaul of the cli ui
- expose all trading data via a websocket api
- event based signal processing
- creating a new plugin type: position strategy

## Disclaimer

- Zenbot is NOT a sure-fire profit machine. Use it AT YOUR OWN RISK.
- Crypto-currency is still an experiment, and therefore so is Zenbot. Meaning, both may fail at any time.
- Running a bot, and trading in general requires careful study of the risks and parameters involved. A wrong setting can cause you a major loss.
- Never leave the bot un-monitored for long periods of time. Zenbot doesn't know when to stop, so be prepared to stop it if too much loss occurs.
- Often times the default trade parameters will underperform vs. a buy-hold strategy, so run some simulations and find the optimal parameters for your chosen exchange/pair before going "all-in".
